@EnableJpaRepositories --> Tells where we will run sql queries. Here it tells hibernate which packages to scan and perform db
                            operations on.

Basically to have multiple database connection in one project, we need to configure three things:-
1. Datasource
2. EntityManager
3. TransactionManager

When we have multiple data sources, we need to map EntityManager for every data source. If in a project, there is only one db, then
default implementation of data source, takes care of EntityManager.
