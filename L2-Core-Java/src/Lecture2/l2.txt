Streams will only run when it has terminal operations. There are 2 types of operations in streams:-
1. Intermediate operations -> it takes streams as input, perform some operations and then returns streams as output.
2. Terminal operations -> It takes streams as input and gives single element as output.

Number of operations is streams is same as compared to number of operations in for loop. It only executes an element once.

Core is the smallest unit of out infrastructure where a thread can run. One thread can run on one core.
Command to check number of cores present in our machine is "Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()"

We can increase our number of threads from JVM, but it is not recommended as it can lead to deadlock at OS level.

The result of the stream which we get, depends on three things:-
1. Type of stream we are using (Parallel or Sequential)
2. Type of Collection we are using(Ordered(e.g. List) or Unordered(e.g. Set)
3. Type of Terminal function we are using(like findFirst() or findAny())

For unordered collections findFirst() does not make sense. It is similar to findAny().
